Deterministic Agent

Gameplay:

    Resistance: Remembers known spies and works against them.
                Votes for players not known to have failed a mission.

    Spy:        Increases likeliness of killing mission as rounds progress.
                Increase negative votes as rounds progress.
                Supports spies in votes more as rounds progress.  Tries to bluff players
                by skewing votes against resistance members that are associated 
                with suspicous activity.
